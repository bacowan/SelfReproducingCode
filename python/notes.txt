# Explanation:
# The program creates a string with a print statement, then executes that string as code. Inside of this string, it reassigns the value of itself.
# Without the inclusion of quotation marks or correct newlines, this could be written as
#
# str = '''str = "str = " + str + "exec(str)"
# print(str)'''
# exec(str)
#
# If we were to then replace the exec statement with the actual code being run, it would look like this
# 
# str = '''str = "str = " + str + "exec(str)"
# print(str)'''
# str = "str = " + str + "exec(str)"
# print(str)
#
# Here we can see that there are three steps (the first two lines include a multiline string, and is thus one line):
# 1. Assign the initial value of the string
# 2. Reassign the string to a value which includes the extra code surrounding the string ('str =' and 'exec')
# 3. Print the result
#
# This in itself isn't complete because it excludes the tripple quotes. To fix this, we simply add the join statements into the string.
# Adding them verbatum wouldn't work since that would close the string, so we have to do it dynamically.
