# Explanation
# This attempts to solve the problem without using any fancy features or extra functions. It just uses string
# manipulation and prints the strings, much like the sample provided in the lecture notes. Notable parts of this are its use of
# r strings to make sure quotes can be escaped but the backslash remains (a unique property of r strings),
# and the use of \n and string.replace to create newlines.
