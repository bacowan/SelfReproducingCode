# Description
# This implementation relies on compiler directives.
# It defines a function which runs whatever code it is given
# and then prints the full command that runs it, and an
# equivelant function which prints first and then runs.
# These two functions are then used to print what comes before
# and after them. Since the the functions also print themselves,
# the code that runs them is taken care of in the output.
